*an alternative to renpy. this is a scripting language made for writers to mass produce dialogue like dragon age veilguard*

i dont know if i believe in it. i dont have an ego, much less any reputability to justify creating something this niche. because my portfolio is empty, i'd run it down without this.

the only thing worse than a crappy game is an unreleased game - my mentor

## Examples

to produce dialogue, use an external file. story.txt to **story.halc**. each char in block of text is yielded until a user input. if you only plan on writing story with this and operate within .halc files. ignore all the python, its for the game engine to handle how to data is broken up, subject to change.

### Examples Featuring User Input
```
### Halc
[main_menu_dialogue]$: Press Z to advance dialogue
$: Use the arrow keys to move around.
$: Please play with the sound on.
$: Use '+' or '-' to increase and decrease the volume
$: Press F1 at any time to see the controls.
$: Does that make sense?
    > No, can you repeat that?
        $: are you sure you realllyyyyy want me to repeat that??
        > repeat it! yes!
            $: ugh fine i will repeat it
            @goto main_menu_dialogue
        > nevermind, dont repeat it.
            $: good boy
            @changeRooms(1 content/BreakRoom)

    > Yes, I'm ready to start.
        $: Thanks for playing. And good luck!
        @changeRooms(1 content/BreakRoom)
@end
```
```python

ideally, button: blank3,4,5 will not display in game. this is just to show you have a limit of 5 choices per frame.

### Examples With Color Text
```
### Halc
[main_menu_dialogue]
$: Hmm. {RED}This {RESET}should be red, and {GREEN}this {RESET}should be green! Got it?
@changeRooms(1 content/BreakRoom)
@end
```
```python
asset : {
"1" : {"speaker": "$", "richtext": ["Hmm. ", 4,"This ", 0,"should be red, ", 5,"this ", 0,"should be green! Got it?"], link: "2"},
"2" : {"directive": "changeRooms", "args": "1 content/BreakRoom"},
}

wtf happened?
its structured very simply. you know how in minecraft creative mode, or any public servers, there are a lot of colored items and signs. i borrowed their structure.

i call it a "red-neck-op-code-jack"
```python
asset : {
"1" : {"speaker": "$", "richtext": [...] :: ARRAY
```
said array inside ["richtext"] can only hold strings and integers in series. whenever the game engine sees a string: display each character slowly on the screen. whenever it sees an integer, check if the opcode exists, and handle future strings appropriately.

lets look under the hood of the red and green text.
```
["Hmm. ", 4,"This ", 0,"should be red, ", 5,"this ", 0,"should be green! Got it?"]
```
what does (4, 0, and 5) :: int mean?
they're arbitrary numbers decided by us.

code 4, means set color to all future text red.

code 5, means set color to all future text green.

[code 0] means reset to default/original.

you may absolutely write `{RED}This{WHITE} should be red`

it looks the same, but better to use `{RESET}`. maybe the default text color in your game isnt white? or maybe you made some other op code changes.

it resets all previous changes. theres also a keybind to automatically append last used, most used, commonly used, `op codes`. this is built into your text edtior specifically for halcyon.

#### Chaining and Overwritting H Op Code
Just like color coding items in minecraft!
```
### Halc
[main_menu_dialogue]
$: Hmm. {ORANGE}{PURPLE}{RED}This {RESET}should be red, and {GREEN}this {RESET}{ORANGE}{RESET}should be green! Got it?
@changeRooms(1 content/BreakRoom)
@end
```
This will compile the exact same python asset and produce the exact same one as above.

{RED}, {GREEN}. yeah you can lower case it so `{red}` and `{green}` will suffice

or you can do `{RAW:4}`
```
### Halc
[main_menu_dialogue]
$: Hmm. {RAW:4}This {RAW:0}should be red, and {RAW:5}this {RAW:0}should be green! Got it?
@changeRooms(1 content/BreakRoom)
@end
```
This will compile the exact same python asset and produce the exact same one as above.


#### Adding Icons
You ask the guy who maintains the game engine to prepare a specific opcode for said image
```
### Halc
[main_menu_dialogue]
$: Can we get a money symbole?{RAW:123}Thanks.
@changeRooms(1 content/BreakRoom)
@end
```
```python
asset : {
"1" : {"speaker": "$", "richtext": ["Can we get a money symbole?", 123,"Thanks "], link: "2"},
"2" : {"directive": "changeRooms", "args": "1 content/BreakRoom"},
}
```
<div align="center">

</div>
the game engine checks if number beside raw is an int. and if it exists in icons. otherwise its a color/animated

#### Creating Animated Text
You know in inscryption when leshly talks his characters a scribbled and animated? This could do something similar.
```
### Halc
[main_menu_dialogue]
$: {ORANGE}{BOLD}{INSCRYPTION}DID I DO THAT?
@changeRooms(1 content/BreakRoom)
@end
```
```python
asset : {
"1" : {"speaker": "$", "richtext": [3, 1, 123, "DID I DO THAT?"], link: "2"},
"2" : {"directive": "changeRooms", "args": "1 content/BreakRoom"},
}
```
<div align="center">
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1381214143964647525/1382547711349489756/Timeline_2.gif?ex=684b8d64&is=684a3be4&hm=0e010087112c5173ea49ad179d137b0a8020ea23c33ffd68656d3fe363bad203&=">
</div>
lets say... `3 = orange; 1 = bold; 123 = inscrpytion animation`
```
### Halc
[main_menu_dialogue]
$: {ORANGE}{BOLD}{INSCRYPTION}DID I DO {RESET}THAT?
@changeRooms(1 content/BreakRoom)
@end
```
and this would show the same as above except `THAT?` would be `white color, not bold, not animated` make sense?

#### Yields
```
### Halc
[main_menu_dialogue]
$: Yields are stored innnn{RAW:-1000} Negative numbers!
@changeRooms(1 content/BreakRoom)
@end
```
```python
asset : {
"1" : {"speaker": "$", "richtext": ["Yields are stored innnn", -1000, "Negative numbers!"], link: "2"},
"2" : {"directive": "changeRooms", "args": "1 content/BreakRoom"},
}
```
we do `miliseconds`. so `{raw:-1000}` would wait `1` second or `{raw:-300}` would wait `0.3` seconds

unfortunately, this means we can never have negative op codes.
